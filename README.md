## Description
This is a very fun game, I remember having the physical version when I was a kid, it was time to recreate the online version, using a bit of JavaScript and manipulating the DOM. It has a very simple and retro design.

## Details
After learning how to manipulate the web DOM well, thanks to TheAppBrewery for the Udemy course, I set out to create this game. The game consists of the user having to press the buttons, in the correct order shown on the screen.

I created the game in August 2021. It has infinite levels and patterns, totally random, for the user to have fun. I did this by creating Random values with JavaScript. Try to beat my record!

## Key Technologies used
